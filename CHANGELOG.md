## [2.0.1] - 2025-08-13

### 🚀 Enhanced Component Detection & CLI Version Management

This release significantly improves component detection capabilities and adds proper CLI version management.

### ✨ Added

#### CLI Version Management
- **`--version` flag** - Show CLI tool version information
  - Display CLI version, git commit, build time
  - Show Go version and OS/Architecture
  - Distinct from `version` command (which shows Kubernetes cluster info)
- **`-v` short flag** - Shorthand for `--version`
- **Build-time version injection** - Proper version embedding via ldflags

#### Enhanced Component Detection
- **Helm Release Detection** - Automatically detect components installed via Helm
  - Scans for Helm secrets with `owner=helm` label
  - Extracts version information from Helm labels
  - Shows Helm release status and metadata
- **Comprehensive Namespace Scanning** - Search ALL namespaces (not just predefined ones)
  - Dynamic namespace discovery and component scanning
  - Expanded component recognition patterns
  - Support for non-standard component locations

#### Expanded Component Support
- **Additional Component Types**:
  - StatefulSets (databases, message queues, etc.)
  - DaemonSets (monitoring, logging agents)
  - Helm releases (any chart-deployed application)
- **Extended Component Library** - Recognition for 25+ common components:
  ```
  metrics-server, argocd, argo, kuma, istio, traefik, 
  nginx, cert-manager, prometheus, grafana, jaeger, 
  kiali, fluentd, elasticsearch, kibana, vault, 
  consul, etcd, redis, postgres, mysql, mongodb,
  kafka, zookeeper, rabbitmq, jenkins, sonarqube,
  nexus, harbor, docker-registry, ingress, gateway
  ```

#### Enhanced Output Format
- **Source Column** - New column showing component source:
  - `Helm` - Installed via Helm chart
  - `Deployment` - Kubernetes Deployment
  - `StatefulSet` - Kubernetes StatefulSet
  - `DaemonSet` - Kubernetes DaemonSet
- **Smart Deduplication** - Prioritizes Helm information when available
- **Improved Feedback** - Better user messaging about search progress

### 🔧 Enhanced

#### Version Command Improvements
- **Clearer Distinction** between CLI version and cluster version
  - `k8s-cli --version` → CLI tool information
  - `k8s-cli version` → Kubernetes cluster information
- **Enhanced Component Discovery Messaging**:
  - Progress indicators during component scanning
  - Total component count in results
  - Better error handling and partial result recovery
- **Comprehensive Component Table** with Source information

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Dynamic Client Integration** - Added Kubernetes dynamic client support
- **Improved Error Handling** - Graceful handling of permission errors
- **Better Resource Management** - Efficient namespace and resource querying

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

#### Version Management
- **Build-time Variables** - Proper version, commit, and build time injection
- **Runtime Version Info** - Go version and platform detection
- **Makefile Integration** - Version information properly embedded during builds

#### Component Detection Engine
- **Multi-source Analysis** - Combines Kubernetes API and Helm secret analysis
- **Pattern-based Recognition** - Intelligent component name matching
- **Duplicate Prevention** - Smart merging of information from multiple sources

#### Testing
- **Version Flag Tests** - Comprehensive testing of new version functionality
- **Component Detection Tests** - Validation of enhanced discovery logic
- **Integration Testing** - End-to-end command validation

### 💼 Business Value

#### DevOps Benefits
- **Complete Infrastructure Visibility** - See ALL installed components, regardless of installation method
- **Helm Integration** - Native support for Helm-managed infrastructure
- **Version Tracking** - Easy identification of component versions for security and compliance

#### SRE & Operations
- **Comprehensive Auditing** - Complete inventory of cluster components
- **Multi-source Discovery** - Find components installed via any method
- **Better Troubleshooting** - Source information helps identify deployment methods

### 🚀 Usage Examples

#### CLI Version Information
```bash
# Show CLI version
k8s-cli --version
# Output: k8s-cli version v2.0.1, Git commit: abc123, Built: 2025-08-13T10:30:00, etc.

# Show CLI version (short form)
k8s-cli -v
```

#### Enhanced Component Discovery
```bash
# Show all components (now includes Helm releases)
k8s-cli version

# Expected improvements:
# - More components detected
# - Helm releases included
# - Source column shows installation method
# - Components found in all namespaces
```

### 🔄 Migration Guide

#### Upgrading to v2.0.1
1. **No Breaking Changes** - All existing functionality preserved
2. **New Features Available** - Enhanced component detection automatic
3. **Version Flag Added** - New `--version` flag for CLI information
4. **Better Results Expected** - More components will be discovered

# Install/update system-wide
make -f Makefile.dev install

# Verify installation
k8s-cli --version
```

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
