## 🔄 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Standardize Language (English)
- Translate ARCHITECTURE.md to English
- Translate API.md to English
- Review all files for Spanish remnants

### Phase 2: Eliminate Duplications
- Consolidate GitHub Actions documentation
- Remove duplicate installation instructions
- Merge overlapping examples

### Phase 3: Reorganize Structure
- Create new directory structure
- Move content to appropriate locations
- Update cross-references

### Phase 4: Update and Modernize
- Update version references to 2.0.6
- Fix outdated commands and examples
- Add missing documentation

### Phase 5: Create Master Index
- New comprehensive documentation index
- Clear navigation structure
- Quick reference sections

## 📊 Content Consolidation Map

### GitHub Actions Documentation
**Current:** 3 files
- docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md (main)
- docs/CI_CD_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md (development focus)
- docs/RELEASE_AUTOMATION.md (release focus)

**Proposed:** 2 files
- docs/ops/ci-cd.md (consolidated workflows)
- docs/developer/development.md (development workflow)

### Installation Documentation
**Current:** Scattered across 4+ files
**Proposed:** Single docs/user/installation.md

### Examples Documentation
**Current:** README.md + docs/EXAMPLES.md + scattered
**Proposed:** Consolidated docs/user/examples.md
